## Reflection Response
Stand up and stand downs helped too clarify what we were doing for the day preventing anyone from feeling lost in the project.

The scrum board alowed to have a visual track of each individual task we needed to complete, letting us break them down into more mangable sections.

We worked on getting the must haves down first and then we worked out what would be some nice to haves or stretch features.

Some things I would have done differently is. perhaps starting earlier for planning. As things always come up during the week its important to be well planned and flexible.
